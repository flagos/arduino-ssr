# arduino-ssr
Drive several SSR that are set on one by one with a round-robin mechanism with an arduino. Arduino is reachable through Ethernet.

This arduino sketch will set on several SSR one by one to limit current usage and do time sharing to dispatch avalaible voltage over several SSR. SSR are supposed to be zero crossing.
